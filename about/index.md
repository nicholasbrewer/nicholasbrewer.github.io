## About Me

I'm Nicholas Brewer: pianist, composer, visual artist, hiker of mountains, etc.

A native of Tucson, Arizona, I began piano lessons at the age of five. During my undergraduate years at Hamilton College I studied with the wonderful Sar Shalom-Strong. My performance experience ranges from solo concerts to 15-piano ensembles. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Piano Performance at the Longy School of Music of Bard College.

Music is on my mind most of the time; I'm often playing, writing, listening to, or thinking about it.

Recently I wrote and recorded an eclectic 70 minute score for a modern dance piece entitled CARNE, choreographed by Esduardo Mariscal. CARNE was performed for three nights in Portland, Maine at the Portland Stage. The soundtrack to CARNE is available on my bandcamp page <a href="http://nicholasbrewer.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">here.</a>
