A self-portrait, Cubbies addresses both the experience of having alopecia areata and of being human. We all put people into boxes, categorize them; it makes it easier to organize our lives. Cubbies is meant to bring to the attention of the viewer that we are all so much more than what we are initially perceived as. I don't fit into some cubbies, others I fill, and some of my experiences don't fit into any of the cubbies behind me.
